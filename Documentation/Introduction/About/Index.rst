What does it do?
================

This extension supports TYPO3 administrators in performing A/B tests. This is useful when a site owner want to measure whether a new version improves or reduces user interaction compared to the current version.


**Features of the extension**

- Caching of each page version
- A real 50/50% chance. That means: No selection by random, because of the unreliable random method. So the versions are always taken alternately.
- Complete different content with same page id. So only one URL for two versions. The displayed version is determined by the cookie value.
