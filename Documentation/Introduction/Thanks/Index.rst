===========
This extension and manual has been created in hours, mostly by a single person.
It is actively maintained to fit all supported TYPO3 versions, user interface concepts and best practice approaches.

If this extension helps you in anyway to achieve your requirements, please think about giving something back.
Or you want to sponsor a feature to extend something that's already there? Then find some ideas to make me happy below - I'm looking forward to get in contact with you!

Nice mails
^^^^^^^^^^
Some nice words fit every time - just drop me some kind words by mail to make me happy :-)

Talk about it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you like what I've built, then share it wherever it fits. Maybe this will help to spread the word and find others that can profit from it, too.

Let's have a tee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're in the region of Aachen, just let me know. I'm always looking forward to meeting new and known faces and to exchange on several topics.

Money
^^^^^
If you have too much of it and want to share parts of your money with me, just let me know and we'll find a way to organize that :-)
